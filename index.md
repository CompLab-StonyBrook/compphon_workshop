# Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to allow students in Fall 2016's [Computational Phonology seminar](https://github.com/StonyBrook-Lin626-F16/main) at [Stony Brook University](http://linguistics.stonybrook.edu) to present their research findings to a wider audience.
The unifying theme of all student presentations is the application of subregular computational models to phonology.
The program covers a wide range of phenomena, including harmony processes, word stress, and metathesis.
Some presentations also explore formal aspects of the computational models or extend them to other language domains, in particular syntax.

# Date & Venue

**Date**: Monday, December 12, 2016  
**Time**: 10:30am to 6:00pm  
**Location**: Linguistics Department, Seminar Room (SBS S-207)

# Invited Speaker

The workshop concludes with a *Frontiers* talk by [Adam Jardine](http://rci.rutgers.edu/~aj591/) ([Rutgers University](http://ling.rutgers.edu/)).
As is common for *Frontiers* talks, we will have dinner with the speaker afterwards at the Hilton Garden Inn.
Please send an email to [workshop@thomasgraf.net](mailto:workshop@thomasgraf.net) if you are interested in attending the dinner.
