  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to allow students in Fall 2016's *Computational Phonology* seminar at Stony Brook University to present their research findings to a wider audience.\r\nThe unifying theme of all student presentations is the application of subregular computational models to phonology.\r\nThe program covers a wide range of phenomena, including harmony processes, word stress, and metathesis.\r\nSome presentations also explore formal aspects of the computational models or extend them to other language domains, in particular syntax.\r\n\r\n# Invited Speaker\r\n\r\nThe workshop program concludes with a *Frontiers* talk by [Adam Jardine](http://rci.rutgers.edu/~aj591/) ([Rutgers University](http://ling.rutgers.edu/)).\r\nAs is common for *Frontiers* talks, we will have dinner with the speaker afterwards at the Hilton Garden Inn.\r\n\r\n# Date & Venue\r\n\r\n**Date**: Monday, December 12, 2016  \r\n**Time**: to be announced; approximately 10am to 6pm  \r\n**Location**: Computational Linguistics Lab (SBS N-249)\r\n\r\n# Program\r\n\r\nto be announced\r\n\r\n# Registration\r\n\r\nNo registration is required.\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\n[Course website](https://github.com/StonyBrook-Lin626-F16/main)",
