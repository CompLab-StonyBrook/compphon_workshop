  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to allow students in Fall 2016's [Computational Phonology seminar](https://github.com/StonyBrook-Lin626-F16/main) at [Stony Brook University](http://linguistics.stonybrook.edu) to present their research findings to a wider audience.\r\nThe unifying theme of all student presentations is the application of subregular computational models to phonology.\r\nThe program covers a wide range of phenomena, including harmony processes, word stress, and metathesis.\r\nSome presentations also explore formal aspects of the computational models or extend them to other language domains, in particular syntax.\r\n\r\n# Invited Speaker\r\n\r\nThe workshop concludes with a *Frontiers* talk by [Adam Jardine](http://rci.rutgers.edu/~aj591/) ([Rutgers University](http://ling.rutgers.edu/)).\r\nAs is common for *Frontiers* talks, we will have dinner with the speaker afterwards at the Hilton Garden Inn.\r\nPlease send an email to [workshop@thomasgraf.net](mailto:workshop@thomasgraf.net) if you are interested in attending the dinner.\r\n\r\n# Date & Venue\r\n\r\n**Date**: Monday, December 12, 2016  \r\n**Time**: 10:30am to 6:00pm\r\n**Location**: Computational Linguistics Lab (SBS N-249)\r\n\r\n# Program\r\n\r\nThe program is still tentative and may undergo some minor changes.\r\n\r\n| Time | Talk |\r\n| --:  | :-- |\r\n| 10:30 - 11:00 | Thomas Graf: *Introduction and Tutorial Session* |\r\n| 11:00 - 11:30 | Hyunah Baek: *Computational representation of unbounded stress patterns: tiers with structural features* |\r\n| 11:30 - 12:00 | Aniello De Santo: *A game of tiers: Exploring the formal properties of TSL languages* |\r\n| 12:00 - 13:00 | Lunch break |\r\n| 13:00 - 13:30 | Alëna Aksënova: *To achieve harmony we only need one tier* |\r\n| 13:30 - 14:00 | Chikako Takahashi: *Multiple metathesis is strictly local: evidence from stress driven metathesis*\r\n| 14:00 - 14:30 | *Blitz talks* |\r\n| 14:30 - 15:00 | Coffee break |\r\n| 15:00 - 15:30 | Hongchen Wu: *Tier-based strictly local analyses of negation in Mandarin Chinese* |\r\n| 15:30 - 16:00 | Lei Liu: *Capturing scope ambiguity with tier-local syntax* |\r\n| 16:00 - 16:30 | Coffee break |\r\n| 16:30 - 18:00 | Adam Jardine: tba |\r\n\r\n# Registration\r\n\r\nNo registration is required for the workshop itself.\r\nFor the Frontiers talk dinner, write to [workshop@thomasgraf.net](mailto:workshop@thomasgraf.net).",
